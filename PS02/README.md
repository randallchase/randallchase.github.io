# Problem Set 2
I completed this problem set by downloading an entire dataset for crime in LA from 2010-present as a 422 MB CSV file. Then, I used python to downsample the data and transform into an 11 MB JSON file for consumption by the website. The CSV file is not included in this repo. However, it can be found at https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Crime-Data-from-2010-to-Present/y8tr-7khq.
